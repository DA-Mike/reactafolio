## Description

This is a project which utilizes React to create a portfolio website for myself. Currently there's only a React front-end, however I will be adding the back-end at a later date.

My motivation for this project was to learn React and build a front-end site utilizing it. It was a great experience which really opened my eyes to how powerful the React library is.
